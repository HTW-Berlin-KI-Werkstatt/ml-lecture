**Task:** Please study the following content. This lecture is all about further classical ML models
{: .notice--warning} 

| Topic | Content | 
| :------------- |  :---------- |
| [Tree-based classifiers](/modules/treebased/treebased.md) | learn how classical ML methods work |
| [Ensembles](/modules/ensembles/ensembles.md) | Ask people that disagree |
| [AutoML](/modules/automl/automl.md) | The sledgehammer of ML |

## ðŸ›  Workshop in the lecture

* Testing different tree-based methods
* Fiddling around with random forests and AutoML
