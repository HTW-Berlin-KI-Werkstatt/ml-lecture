| Topic | Content | 
| :------------- |  :---------- |
| [Embeddings and feature vectors](/modules/featurevectors/featurevectors.md) | It's all about turning *stuff* into vectors |
| [Nearest neighbour classifiers and predictors](/modules/nearest/nearest.md) | learn how the simplest ML method works |
