Welcome to the machine learning course, this course is intended for master students able to tackle  programming with ease, basics of linear algebra as well as calculus. But no worries, we will also repeat math concepts when needed as well.

## ➤ Why but really why is this lecture material in English?

If you work as a machine learning engineer (or a software engineer in general) your main working language (at least when reading) will be English. There is an international community of PhD students around the globe that take care and further develop open-source tools for machine learning. Furthermore, reading current publications and trying to stay-up-to-date is an essential part and can simply not be done in German. Therefore, all documentation and material of the lecture will be in English.

## ➤ What is machine learning?

Whereas there are plenty of definitions for machine learning, let's keep it simple: **Machine learning is about algorithms that learn models from data (and experience)**. The latter term *experience* refers to a sub-part of machine learning known as reinforcement learning, something that we will not cover in the lecture.

## ➤ How is this lecture structured

The lecture follows an reverse-classroom concept originally used by Christina Kratsch in her data science lecture. The event consists of three parts:
* a **theory part**, which you have to *independently read at home* on a weekly basis.
* a **practical part**, which we will *practice together on-site* weekly, and
* a **small project**, which you will *independently create*.

Specifically, we will deal with the following content: [^1]

[^1]: The lecture materials are *work in progress* and will continuously change and evolve. We will likely cover only a certain part of the topics listed.

### Part 0: Because an index always starts with zero

1. [Motivation and latest developments](/lectures/00/00.md) - why is understanding and using machine learning an essential future skill

### Part 1: Getting to know the tools and the math

1. [Definitions, tools and basic math concepts](/lectures/01/01.md) - a tale about vectors and tensors
2. [Fundamental principles and challenges of machine learning](lectures/02/02.md) - how to evaluate machine learning models without cheating

### Part 2: Classical ML and building your first machine learning system

3. [Classical machine learning: Vectors and neighbours](/lectures/03/03.md) - developing our first machine learning models
4. [Ensembles and AutoML](lectures/04/04.md) - combining and optimizing models

### Part 3: From linear models to the first deep learning architectures

5. [Linear models and loss functions](lectures/05/05.md)
6. [Classical neural networks and back-propagation](lectures/06/06.md)
7. [Convolutional neural networks for computer vision and the foundation model principle](lectures/07/07.md)

### Part 4: Large language models - everything is a token

8. [Large language model fundamentals](lectures/08/08.md)
9. [Large-language models in detail](lectures/09/09.md)

### Part 6: Trends and applications

10. On the edge of research: Multimodal vision models, In-context learning, etc.


## ➤ What Will You Learn in This Lecture?

1. You will **understand the basic concepts** of machine learning.
2. You will be able to **select appropiate ML models** for a certain application.
3. You will have the skills to **implement machine learning pipelines** for basic problems.
4. You will be able to **evaluate these pipelines** and **improve them further**. 

## ★ How Will Participation Be Evaluated?

All relevant information regarding the evaluation can be found on Moodle.
