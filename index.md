## ➤ How is this lecture structured

The event consists of three parts:
* a **theory part**, which you are to *independently read at home* on a weekly basis.
* a **practical part**, which we will *practice together on-site* weekly, and
* a **small project**, which you will *independently create* starting from the second half of the semester.

Specifically, we will deal with the following content: [^1]
